# Intro
Kata is a Japanese word meaning "form". It refers to a detailed choreographed pattern of martial arts movements made to be practised alone. It can also be reviewed within groups and in unison when training. It is practised in Japanese martial arts as a way to memorize and perfect the movements being executed.

This repo is exactly that, a series of exercises that, a series of exercises that I studied and attempted to memorize, in order to use them at the perfect time when needed.
